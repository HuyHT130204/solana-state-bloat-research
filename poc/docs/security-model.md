# Security & Threat Model

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the Solana state compression and off-chain data availability system.

## Expanded Threat Model and Assumptions

- Adversaries: storage providers (faulty/malicious), network adversaries, compromised clients, dishonest oracles/relayers.
- Objectives: data withholding, stale data serving, equivocation, commitment corruption, DoS retrieval.
- Assumptions: on-chain commitments (Merkle roots) are final; clients can perform randomized sampling; majority of providers in k-of-n are honest within an epoch.

## Controls & Guarantees

1. Integrity: SHA-256 Merkle proofs from content-addressed blobs; root anchored on-chain.
2. Availability: k-of-n redundancy, periodic liveness attestations, randomized retrieval sampling.
3. Non-equivocation: signed attestations posted to public log; slashing on proven equivocation.
4. Recovery: automatic re-replication on provider failure funded by escrow.

## Threat Vectors

### 1. Data Availability Failure

**Description:** Off-chain data becomes unavailable or corrupted.

**Impact:** High - Could prevent account access and break applications.

**Mitigations:**
- k-of-n redundancy across multiple providers
- Periodic attestations and health checks
- Fallback mirrors and backup systems
- Economic penalties for unavailability
- On-chain commitment verification

**Risk Level:** Medium (mitigated by redundancy)

### 2. Invalid/Malleable Proofs

**Description:** Malicious or corrupted Merkle proofs that pass verification.

**Impact:** Critical - Could lead to incorrect account data.

**Mitigations:**
- Domain-separated hashing to prevent cross-protocol attacks
- Strict proof format validation
- Versioned codecs to prevent format confusion
- Independent security audits
- Fuzzing of proof parsers

**Risk Level:** Low (cryptographically secure)

### 3. Archival Race/Spam

**Description:** Attackers spam archival requests or race to archive first.

**Impact:** Medium - Could disrupt archival process and waste resources.

**Mitigations:**
- Deterministic archival windows based on slot numbers
- Rate limiting on archival requests
- Economic incentives only for first successful archival
- Proof-of-work requirements for archival requests

**Risk Level:** Low (economic disincentives)

### 4. CPI Surface Abuse

**Description:** Malicious programs abuse compression syscalls.

**Impact:** High - Could lead to resource exhaustion or incorrect data.

**Mitigations:**
- Compute unit metering and limits
- Size caps on proof and data requests
- Proof verification before data access
- Syscall gating and authorization
- Program whitelisting for sensitive operations

**Risk Level:** Medium (runtime protections)

### 5. Replay/Consistency Attacks

**Description:** Replaying old proofs or inconsistent state.

**Impact:** High - Could lead to incorrect application state.

**Mitigations:**
- Root commitments per slot
- Replay protection with nonces
- Pointer epochs for state consistency
- Timestamp validation in proofs

**Risk Level:** Low (cryptographic protections)

## Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Primitives

- **Hash Function:** SHA-256 (industry standard)
- **Merkle Trees:** Binary trees with collision resistance
- **Proof Verification:** Deterministic and reproducible
- **Commitment Scheme:** Hash-based commitments

### Access Control

- **Program Authorization:** Whitelist-based access control
- **Syscall Gating:** Runtime-level permission checks
- **Resource Limits:** Compute unit and memory limits
- **Rate Limiting:** Request frequency limits

### Economic Security

- **Stake Requirements:** Validators must stake SOL
- **Slashing Conditions:** Penalties for malicious behavior
- **Reward Distribution:** Incentives for honest behavior
- **Cost Recovery:** Fees cover operational costs
